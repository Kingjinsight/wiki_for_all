This wiki is for those who also study or interested in computer science or artificial intellifgence. In my learning approach, I searching scattered documentation and random blog post or ask LLM's help, which spent countless hours on those thing. This wiki is my attempt to record these tips, gotchas or my experience to save your and mine time.
