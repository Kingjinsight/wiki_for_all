## Why I create this wiki
In the age of AI, getting answers is easy, but learning requires processing. 
If information flows from AI directly to code without passing through the brain, nothing is retained.
This Wiki is my practice of Active Synthesis. It documents knowledge gathered from AI conversations, blog posts, videos, and tools documentation—but most importantly, it contains my own understanding and refined notes.
